## Project Motivation
Protein secondary structure prediction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. In this project, we explored early heuristic-based methods for predicting secondary structures from amino acid sequences. Our focus was on implementing and analyzing classical algorithms, including **Chou-Fasman**, **GOR**, and a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**. Instead of using modern deep-learning-based methods like AlphaFold2, we aimed to understand and evaluate the performance of these earlier models in predicting secondary structures such as **alpha helices, beta sheets, turns, and coils**.

## Computational Problem
The goal of this project was to develop a computational pipeline that, given an amino acid sequence, outputs a corresponding secondary structure sequence. The prediction accuracy was evaluated against **DSSP**-derived experimental secondary structures. Our models were designed to be lightweight, using minimal computational resources and classical probabilistic and statistical approaches instead of large-scale deep learning.

## Running the R Shiny Applications
### Prerequisites
- **R (Version 4.1 or higher)**
- **RShiny package installed:** `install.packages("shiny")`

2. Load `AppUI.R`.
3. Click **Run App**.
4. Use the interface to:
   - Enter a protein sequence or upload a FASTA file.
   - Select Chou-Fasman, GOR, or HMM models.
   - View predicted structures and comparison graphs.

### Run auto_Validation.R
1. Open **RStudio**.
2. Load `auto_Validation.R`.
3. Click **Run App**.
4. Upload a CSV file containing:
   - `ProteinName`
   - `ProteinSequence`
   - `DSSPSequence`
5. Outputs include:
   - Per-protein accuracy.
   - Model-wise performance metrics.
   - Graphical comparisons of precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Overview of Algorithms
### Chou-Fasman Algorithm
A sliding window-based method that assigns **propensity scores** to amino acids, identifying helix and sheet nucleation sites. Overlapping predictions are resolved based on higher propensity values.

### Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson (GOR) Algorithm
Uses **information theory** to evaluate each amino acid's likelihood of forming a secondary structure based on **neighboring residues**. Employs probability tables derived from known protein structures.

### Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Models protein structures as **hidden states** in a Markov chain. **Viterbi decoding** is used to determine the most likely sequence of secondary structures based on trained **transition and emission probabilities**.

## Model Performance and Validation
### Accuracy
- **Chou-Fasman:** 35.02%
- **GOR:** 41.19%
- **HMM:** 47.29%

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** calculated for **Helices (H), Beta Sheets (E), Turns (T), and Coils (C)**.
- **HMM showed highest accuracy**, but **GOR had lower variance** in predictions.
- **Turns were least accurately predicted** across all models.
